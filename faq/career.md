# Career & Learning Journey

## From Translator to Tech & DevRel
My journey started in **interpretation & translation**, but my curiosity led me into **technical writing, frontend development**.

I transitioned into **AI documentation**, where I worked on **AI accelerators, compilers, and large-scale API docs**. Now, I am delving deeper into different tools and web programming to create engaging, developer-friendly documentation.

## What Iâ€™m Learning Now
- **JavaScript for frontend enhancements**.
- **Static Site Generators**

## Future Goals
- **Create Online Courses** for new tech writers.
- **Develop More DevRel Content** (blogs, tutorials, events).
- **Expand My Frontend Skills** with React & Next.js.
