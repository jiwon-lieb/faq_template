# Career & Learning Journey

## From Translator to Tech & DevRel
My journey started in **interpretation & translation**, but my curiosity led me into **technical writing, frontend development, and DevRel**.

I transitioned into **AI documentation**, where I worked on **AI accelerators, compilers, and large-scale API docs**. Now, I create engaging, developer-friendly documentation and work on **community building**.

## What I’m Learning Now
- **JavaScript for frontend enhancements**.
- **Building & scaling developer communities**.
- **Advanced DevRel strategies**.

## Future Goals
- **Create Online Courses** for new tech writers.
- **Develop More DevRel Content** (blogs, tutorials, events).
- **Expand My Frontend Skills** with React & Next.js.
