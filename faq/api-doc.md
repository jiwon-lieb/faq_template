# MBTI Pep Talk API Documentation

## How I Built the MBTI Pep Talk API

The MBTI Pep Talk API started as a weekend project to explore API documentation and improve my understanding of backend development. It evolved into a full-fledged API that provides motivational pep talks based on MBTI personality types and moods, supporting multiple languages and structured documentation.
 
## How It Started

As a technical writer, I wanted to work with APIs beyond just documenting them. So, I decided to build my own API from scratch. At first, I used Netlify Functions for a basic GET request, but soon realized I needed a more scalable and structured backend.

## Tech Stack & Features
- Django REST Framework (DRF) + SQL: API development and data base
- CRUD Operations: New pep talks can be added, modified, or deleted
- Multi-language Support (English & Korean): users can toggle between languages
- Deployed on a Cloud Server

## Writing the API Documentation (GitBook)

Once the API was functional, I focused on API documentation to make it developer-friendly. I used GitBook to create a structured and interactive documentation hub.

### Key Documentation Elements

- Endpoints & Parameters: Clear request/response formats
- Authentication: API key-based access for modifying content
- Example Requests: Postman examples for testing
- Usage Guidelines: Best practices for integrating the API

## Final Takeaways & GitHub Repo

This project helped me improve both my backend and technical writing skills. Creating an API from scratch gave me a deeper understanding of the developerâ€™s perspective, making me a better API writer.
