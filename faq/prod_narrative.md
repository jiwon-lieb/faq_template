## Defining a Clear Narrative for Rebellions

One of the biggest challenges at Rebellions was the lack of a unified **product narrative**. With multiple stakeholders creating content independently, inconsistencies arose in tone, messaging, and clarity. To fix this, I led the creation of a **Product Narrative Sheet**, working closely with engineers, marketing, and leadership. 

### **What I Did**
- Consolidated existing product messaging to **ensure consistency**.
- Aligned technical, business, and marketing teams under a **single content direction**.
- Introduced a streamlined workflow, reducing content review cycles by **30%**.

### **Impact**
✅ Improved content clarity across marketing materials, white papers, and website copy.  
✅ Faster approval process, as all stakeholders aligned on messaging from the start.  
✅ A structured **reference document** for engineers and marketing teams to use moving forward.
